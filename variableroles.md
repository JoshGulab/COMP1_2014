#variable roles
##1.Describe each variable role in your own words.
FIXED VALUE - a variable set without any calculations or changed in anyway e.g. height = 54

STEPPER - a variable that increments each time it goes through a while or if loop. it can show how many times the loop was repeated.

MOST RECENT HOLDER - is the most recent value that was assigned to the variable.

MOST WANTED HOLDER - a value assigned to a variable after a certain condition is met e.g. if currentnumber > number:
number = currentnumber. This means the greatest number is always stored by the variable number.

GATHERER - a variable showing the running total of a calculation so far.

TRANSFORMATION - the result of a mathmatical calculation of other variables

FOLLOWER - a copy of a other variable before it is modified.

TEMPORARY = a variable holding a value for a short period of time such as swapping values in variables in a bubble sort.

##2.Give an example of variable from the program code for each variable role.

FIXED VALUE -   NoOfSwaps = 1000

STEPPER -    Count = Count + 1

MOST RECENT HOLDER - PlayerName = input('Please enter your name: ')

GATHERER - NoOfCardsTurnedOver = NoOfCardsTurnedOver + 1

TRANSFORMATION - none

FOLLOWER - RecentScores[Count].Name = PlayerName

TEMPORARY - none
