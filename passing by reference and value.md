##1.Describe the difference between passing by value and passing by reference in your own words
Passing by value is bringing in a copy of the original value. This means that when it is changed or modified the change is only made within the function. This means that the original value will stay the same, unaffected. 
Passing by reference brings in the original value. This means that if it were to be altered/changed it would saved to memory, allowing it to be used elsewhere.
